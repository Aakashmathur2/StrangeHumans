# Strange Humans
The app will cover following points:
1) The app will take information from the user like his/her name, sex, photo etc. The person can also feed the details of his family members.
2) Whenever there is internet connection available to the user, the app will take his/her location and store the data and will save an offline map of the user's locality.
3) At the time of disaster:
  (a) If the user has internet connection, he/she can send his location to the relief camp through the app. The app will send him/her the location of the nearest relief camp.
  (b) If the person has internet connection, he/she can start a gatherting point(GP). If he/she starts a GP, he/she will be asked to wait for some definite time at that place (preferably near a common/popular place) i.e. the app will return the time for which he/she will have to wait for other people to gather there. Then, he/she will reply Yes/No whether he/she can wait or not.
  (c) If the person doesn't have an internet connection, then he/she can send an SMS to the relief camp through the app. His/her location will consist of the name of a common/popular place/locality nearby. The app will return him/her 2 choices - (i) the address of the relief camp, (ii) the address of the nearest GP and a time limit in which he/she will be asked to reach the GP. Then the person will reply whether he/she is going to the relief camp or to the GP (if he/she can reach the GP in the time limit). Then the person will use the offline map to reach the relief camp/GP.
  (d) If people gather at a GP, they can head together towards the relief camp.
  (e) The app will also send the users the location/address of their relatives.
4) There will also be a section in the app named "Disaster Management Guide"(DMG). Under DMG, there will be sub-sections for all types of disasters and here, the app will provide tips, do's and dont's for disaster management.

The app is useful as the people can reach the relief camp at the time of disaster. It takes safety into account. The app will then be uploaded online. The app connects the people at relief camp and those struck in disaster.
