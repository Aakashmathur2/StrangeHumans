# Strange Humans
The app will cover following points:
1) The app will take information from the user like his/her name, sex, photo etc. The person can also feed the details of his family members.
2) Whenever there is internet connection available to the user, the app will take his/her location and store the data and will save an offline map of the user's locality.
3) At the time of disaster:
  (a) If the user has internet connection, he/she can send his/her location to the relief camp through the app. The app will send him/her the location of the nearest relief camp and the people at the relief camp can reach the user.
  (b) If the person has internet connection, he/she can also start a gatherting point(GP). If he/she starts a GP, he/she will be asked to wait for some definite time at that place (preferably near a common/popular place) i.e. the app will return the time for which he/she will have to wait for other people to gather there. Then, he/she will reply Yes/No whether he/she can wait or not.
  (c) If the person doesn't have an internet connection, then he/she can send an SMS to the relief camp through the app. His/her location will consist of the name of a common/popular place/locality nearby. The app will return him/her 2 choices - (i) the address of the relief camp, (ii) the address of the nearest GP and a time limit in which he/she will be asked to reach the GP. Then the person will reply to choose one of them. If he/she chooses the relief camp, then the people from the relief camp will come to save him/her else if he/she chooses GP, then he/she will be asked to reach the GP in a specified amount of time. 
  (d) If people gather at a GP, it will be easy for the people at the relief camp to save a large number of people in one go.
  (e) The app will also send the users the location/address of their relatives.
4) There will also be a section in the app named "Disaster Management Guide"(DMG). Under DMG, there will be sub-sections for all types of disasters and here, the app will provide tips, do's and dont's for disaster management.

The app is useful as the people can reach the relief camp at the time of disaster. It takes safety into account. The app will then be uploaded online. The app connects the people at relief camp and those struck in disaster.
